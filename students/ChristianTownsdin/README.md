Christian Townsdin is very tall, 6'8", which is 80 inches, or 2 meters.
Fun fact, about 1 in 15k people are this tall.

Christian Townsdin enjoys Triathlon, that's swim bike run.  He says he enjoys 
variety in his workouts, but he might have a little bit of adhd. ;P

I recently graduated from WGU Washington with a degree in IT - Software Development emphasis, 
but found my academic experience was not quite enough to prepare me for top jobs
in the Seattle area, so I'm hoping CodeFellows can help me bridge that gap.

My beloved pet is a comet goldfish, who at the ripe old age of approx 10 
years old, is now about 14 inches long.  

I'm interested in the JS dev accelerator.
